### Task 1 Setup & Execution

1. **It is recommended to install Python 3.10.14.**
    
    This project **requires CUDA** for GPU acceleration.
    
    Please ensure that CUDA (version 12.1 or compatible) is properly installed on your system.
    
    Then, change to the following directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd task_1/machine_learning/bigbird
    ```
    
2. **Install required packages**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url <https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121>
    ```
    
3. **Training**
    
    ```bash
    python3 train.py
    ```
    
    - When you run `train.py`, the model will perform **k-fold training**.
    During this process:
        - Each foldâ€™s evaluation results are stored in the `kfold_results` directory.
        - The trained models and calibrators are stored in the `final_model` directory.
4. **Test**
    
    ```bash
    python3 test.py
    ```
    
    - The trained model from the training phase is used to predict labels for the test dataset.
    - The results are saved in the `final_model_result` directory, which contains the following files:
        - **Prediction Results**
            - **`test_prediction.csv`**
            A CSV file summarizing the test dataset predictions, including:
                - `doc_id`, `fame`
                - Model-generated probability for each fold (`p_machine`)
                - Ensemble setting (`ensemble`, default = `mean`)
                - Decision threshold (`theta`, default = `0.5`)
                - Predicted label (`y_pred`)
        - **Additional Files**
            - **`p_machine_hist.png`**, **`pred_class_distribution.png`**, **`pred_summary.json`**, **`pred_summary.txt`**
            These files visualize and summarize the predicted probability distribution and class distribution across documents.
