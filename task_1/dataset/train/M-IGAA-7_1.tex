%Input
Let $\delta^T$ be the final perturbation after $T$ iterations, where each update is determined by an adaptive step size $\alpha_t$ and a direction vector $q_t$. The attack iteratively refines $\delta$ by summing weighted update steps over multiple iterations.

Given:
- $T$: Total number of iterations.
- $\alpha_t$: Step size at iteration $t$.
- $q_t$: Update direction at iteration $t$.
- $\delta^T$: Final accumulated perturbation.

The objective is to iteratively refine the perturbation $\delta$ using an accumulation process over $T$ iterations.


%Output
The output is the final perturbation $\delta^T$ after $T$ iterations.

%Formula
$\delta^T = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t q_t$

%Explanation
The Iterative Gradient Accumulation Attack (IGAA) variant accumulates updates from each iteration to refine the perturbation. This variant differs from the main PGD Fast-Universal attack by using an iterative summation of step sizes and gradients, rather than updating the perturbation at each step in a single direction. This variant maintains the core principle of adapting the perturbation based on the model's gradient but introduces an accumulation process that refines the perturbation over multiple iterations.
