%Input
The input includes the current perturbation $p$, the original prediction $y$, the input image $x$, the adversarial perturbation $\delta$, the scaling factor $\alpha$, and the random vector $q$. The function $h(\cdot)$ represents the prediction function of the model.

%Output
$p' = p(h(y | x + \delta + \alpha q))$

%Formula
\begin{equation*}
p' = p \left( h \left( y \mid x + \delta + \alpha q \right) \right)
\end{equation*}

%Explanation
The variant Discrete Cosine Transform Meta Attack (DCTM) equation represents a transformation applied in the SimBA-DCT method. It updates the perturbation $p'$ based on the current perturbation $p$ and the model's prediction $h(y | x + \delta + \alpha q)$. The updated perturbation $p'$ is then computed based on these predictions.

This variant differs from the main PGD Fast-Universal attack in its use of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) to modify the input image. The DCT method introduces this new transformation, which can potentially improve the effectiveness and stealthiness of the adversarial attacks generated by the DCT method.
