%Input
The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clean example: \( x \)
    \item True label: \( y \)
    \item Number of iterations: \( T \)
    \item Step size: \( \alpha \)
    \item Perturbation constraint per step: \( \|\delta_t\| \leq \epsilon \)
    \item Total perturbation constraint: \( \|\sum_{t=1}^{T} \delta_t\| \leq \epsilon \cdot T \)
\end{itemize}

%Output
Adversarial example $\tilde{x}$ such that:
\[
\tilde{x} = x + \sum_{t=1}^T \delta_t,
\]
with the total perturbation constrained by \( \|\sum_{t=1}^T \delta_t\| \leq \epsilon \cdot T \).

%Formula
Initialization
   \[
   \tilde{x}^{(0)} = x, \quad \delta_t = 0 \text{ for } t \in \{1, 2, \ldots, T\}.
   \]

Iterative update of the perturbation
   \[
   \delta_t = \alpha \cdot \nabla_{\tilde{x}^{(t-1)}} L(f(\tilde{x}^{(t-1)}), y), \quad \text{with } \|\delta_t\| \leq \epsilon.
   \]

Update the input with the perturbation
   \[
   \tilde{x}^{(t)} = \tilde{x}^{(t-1)} + \delta_t.
   \]

Ensure the total perturbation remains imperceptible
   \[
   \tilde{x}^{(T)} = x + \sum_{t=1}^T \delta_t, \quad \text{with } \|\tilde{x}^{(T)} - x\| \leq \epsilon \cdot T.
   \]

%Explanation
The Boiling Frogs Adversarial Attack introduces perturbations \( \delta_t \) in small increments over \( T \) steps. Each perturbation is computed to maximize the model's loss \( L(f(\tilde{x}), y) \). By ensuring \( \|\delta_t\| \leq \epsilon \) at each step, the attack remains stealthy, while the cumulative effect of the perturbations misleads the model $f$. This gradual approach highlights the adversarial vulnerability of the model over time.

The variant Constrained Iterative Perturbation Attack (CIPA) differs from the main perturbation core in that it ensures the total perturbation remains imperceptible by adding a constraint to the update rule. The original attack does not have this additional constraint, which means the cumulative effect of the perturbations is not explicitly bounded. This new variant introduces an additional layer of control over the attack's behavior, making it more robust and targeted.
