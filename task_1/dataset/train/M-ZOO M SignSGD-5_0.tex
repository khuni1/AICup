%Input
Objective function: $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$
Constraints:
$x_1^2 + x_2^2 &\leq 2$ \\
$x_1 &\geq 0$ \\
$x_2 &\geq 0$

%Output
\[
(x_1, x_2) = (1, 1), \quad f(x_1, x_2) = 2
\]

%Formula
We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the optimization problem.

Define the Lagrangian function:
\[
\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \lambda, \mu_1, \mu_2) = x_1 + x_2 + \lambda(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2) - \mu_1 x_1 - \mu_2 x_2
\]
Taking the partial derivatives of $\mathcal{L}$ and setting them equal to zero, we obtain the following system of equations:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_1} = 1 + 2\lambda x_1 - \mu_1 = 0, \quad
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_2} = 1 + 2\lambda x_2 - \mu_2 = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2 = 0, \quad
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mu_1} = -x_1 = 0, \quad
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mu_2} = -x_2 = 0
\]
From these conditions, we derive:
\[
x_1 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x_2 = 0
\]
However, this does not satisfy the constraint $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2$. Therefore, we consider the case when $\mu_1 = 0$ and $\mu_2 = 0$, leading to:
\[
\lambda = -\frac{1}{2x_1} = -\frac{1}{2x_2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_1 = x_2
\]
Substituting $x_1 = x_2$ into the constraint:
\[
2x_1^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_1 = 1
\]
Thus, the optimal solution is $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1$, yielding:
\[
f(1, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2
\]

%Explanation
ZOO (Zeroth-Order Optimization) or MI-SignSGD (Momentum-Injected Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent) where the problem involves minimizing $x_1 + x_2$ subject to the constraint that the variables lie inside a circle of radius $\sqrt{2}$ and are non-negative. The Lagrangian function incorporates the constraints using Lagrange multipliers. After solving the system of partial derivatives, we found that the optimal solution occurs at $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1$, yielding a minimum objective function value of $f(1, 1) = 2$.
to the minimization problem is $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 1)$ with a minimum objective function value of $f(x_1, x_2) = 2$. This solution satisfies the given constraints.
