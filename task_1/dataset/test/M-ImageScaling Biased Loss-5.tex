%Input
Let \( x \) be the original input image, \( s \) be the scaling factor, and \( \delta \) be the perturbation added after scaling. The attack optimizes an adversarial perturbation under a biased loss function that directs the model's prediction towards a specific target class \( y_k \). The adversary manipulates both the spatial properties and the classification bias to generate adversarial examples effectively.

%Output
The output of the image scaling biased loss weighted optimization adversarial attack is an adversarial example $x^*$ generated by applying scaling transformations to the original image $x$ with a bias towards certain classes.

%Formula
$x^* = \text{Scale}(x, s) + \delta$

- $\text{Scale}(x, s)$ denotes the scaling operation applied to the image $x$ with a scaling factor $s$,
- $\delta$ represents the perturbation added to the scaled image to achieve the desired adversarial effect.

The objective can be framed as:
$\min_{\delta} \; \|x^* - x\|_p \quad \text{subject to} \quad f_\theta(x^*) = y_k$

where:
- $\|\cdot\|_p$ is the norm measuring the distance between the original and perturbed images,
- $f_\theta(x^*)$ is the model's output for the adversarial example with a bias towards class $k$.

%Explanation
In image scaling biased loss weighted optimization attacks, the adversary manipulates the size and dimensions of the input image to create an adversarial example. The attack alters the spatial features that the model relies on for classification by applying a scaling transformation to the image. A perturbation $\delta$ is then added to ensure that the model's output is directed towards a specific class $k$. This method exploits the sensitivity of models to changes in image dimensions and the bias towards certain classes, allowing for the generation of adversarial examples that can evade detection while remaining visually similar to the original input. The variant differs from the main perturbation core by introducing a biased loss function that guides the perturbation towards a specific class, making the attack more targeted and effective.
