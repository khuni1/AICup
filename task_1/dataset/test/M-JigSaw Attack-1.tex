%Input
The input includes the perturbation $v'$, the original input $v$, the norm $p$, and the constraint $\xi$.

%Output
The output is the perturbation $v'$ that minimizes the distance to the original input $v$ while satisfying the constraint on its norm.

%Formula
$P_{p, \xi}(v) = \text{arg min}_{v'} \| v - v' \|_2^2 \quad \text{subject to} \quad \| v' \|_p \leq \xi$

%Explanation
JigSaw Attack-Gradient Regularized where,
Function Definition:
$P_{p, \xi}(v)$
Denotes the function that generates the perturbation $v'$ for the input $v$ under the specified norms and constraints.

Objective Function:
$\| v - v' \|_2^2$
Represents the squared $L_2$ distance between the original input $v$ and the perturbed input $v'$. The objective is to minimize this distance.

Norm of Perturbation:
$\| v' \|_p$
Denotes the $L_p$-norm of the perturbation $v'$, where $p$ determines the type of norm used (e.g., $p = 2$ for $L_2$ norm).

Constraint on Perturbation Magnitude:
$\xi$
Specifies the maximum allowable magnitude of the perturbation, controlling the strength of the attack.
